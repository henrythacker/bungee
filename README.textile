h2. Bungee - test harness

!http://github.com/henrythacker/bungee/raw/master/example.png!

h3. Installation

Download the script from GitHub, move into the folder *below* your main compiler project folder and run the following:

@git clone git://github.com/henrythacker/bungee.git@

Download the following required ruby gem:

@sudo gem install rainbow@

Move into your *compilers folder* and create symlinks to the test scripts

@ln -s ../bungee/test_harness/bungee.rb bungee.rb@
@ln -s ../bungee/examples/ examples@
@sudo chmod +x bungee.rb@

Change your interpreter so that the result of the script looks like (the immediate line break is important):

@Result: [INTEGER]\n@

h3. Run test harness

To run the test harness, move into the compilers folder and execute:

@ruby bungee.rb examples@

h3. Add new examples

You should be able to fork your own copy of the repository (click the fork button above). A git url will be presented (select the non-public git URL), clone this onto your local machine, add your new examples and push to your forked copy (@git push origin master@). Once you're done, come back to your forked project page, click the "Pull Request" button at the top, send me a quick message and after testing, I'll merge your changes in.
